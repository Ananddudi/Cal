# Calculator
calculator with pyqt5
  the main file is MainCal.py. all others are just module which the main file importing.
this poject made in pyqt5 and as everyone know it is cross platform. 
i have tested it on linux distro ubuntu worked very well and efficient.if anyone wants to test on other OS such as Windows or mac,they must have PYTHON3 Interpreter and pyqt5 module.
if you do not want to do extra work let me know i will make it for your OS compatible and just one binary file using pyinstaller.
if anyone haven't understood anything. feel free to ask.
