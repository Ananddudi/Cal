It is my first project. <i>The objective was to create something important enough which can seamlessly work on any platform with same code base that leverages world's most popular programming language <b>Python</b></i><br/>
<h4>Some of key points :-</h4> 
<ul>
  <li>For User interface <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/ui-design-tools">QT Designer</a> is used</li>
  <li>A extra feature is add which deals with percentage calculation</li>
  <li>For calculation math module is used</li>
  <li>I took advantage of regular expression</li>
</ul> 
PyQt5 is cross-platform GUI toolkit which helps to develop an interactive desktop application with ease and simplicity so it became my first choice to get my head around.

In order to installing the finished application two obvious things are mandatory, the <b>Python >> 3.0</b> and the <b>PyQt5</b> module.

if above installation looks not seems feasible then there is astonishing python package is available called <i><b>PyInstaller</i></b>.Basically it bundles the application and all its dependencies into a single package equivalent to windows .exe(executable) file, a binary file so you dont have to install/download anything mentioned above but there is small gotcha that is you needs to make distinct packages for execute application in that specific platform.  Well <a href="https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">here</a> is a complete description.:blush:
